Goal: Build a Python application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for a given location using an API like OpenWeatherMap.

Structure:

-User Interface: Design a console-based user interface for input and output, allowing users to interact with the calculator using simple commands or GUI using libraries like Tkinter (optional).
-Functionality: Implement features to perform basic arithmetic operations, error handling for invalid inputs, and support for decimal or integer inputs.
-Reports: Generate reports or logs of performed operations (optional) and save them into a text file or a database.

Technologies:

-Python: For developing the application's core logic and features.
-Tkinter (Optional): For building a GUI- based calculator with buttons, input fields, and result displays.
-SQLite (Optional): For saving the history of operations performed by the user.
Optional:
-SQLite: For persistent data storage to save the user's history of calculations.
-Pandas (Optional): For storing the history in a table format and generating reports for operations performed.
-Logging: For generating logs of calculations performed and storing them for later reference.
